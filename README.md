# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

This repository contains some implementations of Reinforcement Learning algorithms.

## Overview

### sutton_exercises
Contains the solutions to several programming exercises from the Sutton and Barto Book "Reinforcement Learning"

### openai_spinning_up
Implementation of some of the most important deep reinforcement learning algorithms, including some notebooks to visualize the results.

### deep_neuro_evolution
Implementation of an algorithm explained in this paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.06567.pdf). This is not reinforcement learning in the classical sense, but it tackles the same problems.

### misc
Several test notebooks to try out some thing like multiprocessing etc.

## Usage

All the code is contained in Jupyter notebooks or python modules. Either way all necessary dependencies can be installed via a virtual environment and the requirements file

        cd rl-zoo
        python3 -m venv venv
        . venv/bin/activate
        pip install -r requirements.txt
