# Collection of some Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

## Summary

The set of algorithms corresponds to the choice suggested by OpenAI Spinning Up course (https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/). Namely the following algorithms were implemented:

1. Vanilla Policy Gradient (aka REINFORCE)
2. Deep-Q-Network
3. Synchronous Actor-Critic Methods
4. Proximal Policy Optimization
5. Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient

## Results

Following, there are some results from the implementation of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm on two well-known test enviroments for reinforcement learning from the OpenAI Gym Enviroment ().
